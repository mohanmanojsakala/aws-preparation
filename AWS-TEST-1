Question 35: Correct
A company is deploying an application in the AWS Cloud. How can they secure the application? (Select TWO.)






Explanation
In this scenario the company must apply best practice principals for securing their application. Enabling encryption for data at rest is definitely a good practice and data in transit should also be encrypted where possible as well. It is also a good practice to limit access privileges according to the principal of least privilege. This means limiting privileges to those required to perform a specific role.

CORRECT: "Enable encryption for the application data at rest" is a correct answer.

CORRECT: "Limit access privileges according to the principal of least privilege" is also a correct answer.

INCORRECT: "Configure public access for the AWS services used by the application" is incorrect. In some cases public access may be required and in that case only the front end service(s) should be configured for public access. Otherwise it would be best to not enable public access.

INCORRECT: "Enable monitoring by turning off encryption for data in transit" is incorrect. There is no need to turn off encryption in transit to enable monitoring and this would reduce security.

INCORRECT: "Provide full admin access to developer and operations staff" is incorrect. This is not a security best practice; it is better to assign permissions according to the principal of least privilege

Question 59: Correct
A company uses Amazon EC2 instances to run applications that are dedicated to different departments. The company needs to break out the costs of these applications and allocate them to the relevant department. The EC2 instances run in a single VPC.

How can the company achieve these requirements?





Explanation
The company should create cost allocation tags that specify the department and assign them to resources. These tags must be activated so they are visible in the cost allocation report. Once this is done and a monthly cost allocation report has been configured it will be easy to monitor the costs for each department.

CORRECT: "Create tags by department on the instances and then run a cost allocation report" is the correct answer.

INCORRECT: "Enable billing access for IAM users and view the costs in Cost Explorer" is incorrect. Cost explorer will not show a breakdown of the costs by department.

INCORRECT: "Enable billing alerts through Amazon CloudWatch and Amazon SNS" is incorrect. A billing alert simply lets you know you have reached a cost threshold.

INCORRECT: "Add additional Amazon VPCs and launch each application in a separate VPC" is incorrect. This will not help as billing is not broken out by VPC so they will not be able to determine the costs per department using this method.
